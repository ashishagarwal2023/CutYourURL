## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

I just wanted to have a cool project, and I made this. I also need to shorten some URLs, and bit.ly's URL shortner is good but not free and it requires me to have a account.

For being lazy to login, I just made this. 🧐

Just a party to include in my full-stack list. Also, this domain is just a 1-year domain from GitHub Student Dev Pack, I'm not sure where would I move it after it expires.

## 🎥 Demo / Working <a name = "demo"></a>

Demo will be available soon.

## 💭 How it works <a name = "working"></a>

Based on Python-Flask. It saves your shortened URLs to a database and keeps logging infos too. This makes it much easier and faster to have a API!

Logs are saved to /cache/logs/shorts.log and only logs shorts-related info. Database in /cache/shorts.db.


## Running locally
### Prerequisites

Make venv yourself, then install the flask package.

```bash
python3 -m pip install flask
```

### Running

```bash
python3 main.py
```
