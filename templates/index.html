		<p>
			If you visit to <a href="https://cutyoururl.tech" target="_blank">cutyoururl.tech</a> you will automatically be redirected to here, and I made that because on free PythonAnywhere plan, there is no way to add custom domains, so I made a redirect to here.

			This project is just one of my stack projects, and I have a lot more projects on my <a href="https://github.com/ashishagarwal2023/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile, you can check them out. This project is hosted for completely free and I cannot afford a bit on this, so I have to use free services. Anyways, thank you for reading it this far!
