        <h2>Powerful, light-weight, fast, free URL shortner</h2>
        <p>
            Built on Python, this is a simple yet powerful, light-weight, fast and free URL shortner.<br>It's currently under development, and is <a href="https://github.com/ashishagarwal2023/CutYourURL/" target="_blank">open-source</a> on GitHub. Programmed by <a href="https://github.com/ashishagarwal2023" target="_blank">ashishagarwal2023</a> and some other fellow <a href="https://github.com/ashishagarwal2023/CutYourURL/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">contributors</a>.

        </p>
        <h2>Why and What's coming?</h2>
        <p>
            This URL shortner service is based on a free 1-year TechDomains's student plan's custom domain. Neither it earn any profit for me, nor I got a credit card or bank account to recieve payments to, there are literally no ads, no data is shared, etc. To support me, you can sponsor me on <a href="https://patreon.com/ashish_agarwal" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.
            <br><br>
            Please do not nuke me or my project, it is only 1-year validity for the 100MB of storage. Hosted on Railway, thanks railway for it too.
            <br><br>
            I'm actively working on this project. Currently I've added link shortening, click tracking, authentication, recent shorts, QR code generating and logging. I'm actively spending like atleast 3 hours daily on this project to continue it. I'm planning to add more features like custom short links, dashboard, API to short links, custom-length links, browser-extension, advanced options and lot more.
