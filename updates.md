## What is added
Nothing is added in this commit today, but some good things:
- We got a custom domain now!

My Github Student Dev Pack got approved and now I have access to the lot perks. For you all guys, I bought the domain <a href="https://cutyoururl.tech" target="_blank">cutyoururl.tech</a> domain! Now the URLs should be really short!

- Changed hosting provider: PythonAnywhere --> Railway.App

PythonAnywhere didn't had a custom domain option for free users, so I had to change the hosing provider. [Railway.app](https://railway.app) worked as a good hosting provider so now we'll be using it.

> In edition to the new custom domain, you can use both of these links to work the same:
> - [cutyoururl.tech](https://cutyoururl.tech/)
> - [cutyoururl-production.up.railway.app](https://cutyoururl-production.up.railway.app/)
>
> The second link is from railway.app and it should be always on I guess, however the cutyoururl.tech one is only available for one year.
