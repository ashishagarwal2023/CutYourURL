## News

It's been 01:59 (20 March) but I consider it 19 March for sure.

- Railway is not going to be our preffered hosting provider.

The reason was also bad for me. On every commit, it rebuilds from a new VM the webapp (deleting all cache/datas). This
was not good!

I've got to use PythonAnywhere back, however do not worry anyone, we will have the [cutyoururl.tech](cutyoururl.tech)
domain still!
> In edition to the new custom domain, you can use both of these links to work the same:
> - [cutyoururl.tech](https://cutyoururl.tech/) (Very soon coming back)
> - [cutyoururl-production.up.railway.app](https://cutyoururl-production.up.railway.app/) (Very soon coming back because
	it is encountering errors)
> - Very soon, we will have a new domain for the webapp, but it's not ready yet.

## Modifications

A new feature has been added, lez go!

<details><summary>Some widgets are now under templates/widgets</summary>
Just to organize code, short.html is there too, user.html because we are reusing it.</details>
<details><summary>reCAPTCHA Authentication</summary>
As of recent ideas, I've added a reCAPTCHA authentication and advanced options to generate a custom URL.
