## News

- Yesterday: added expiryClicks - to delete shorts automatically when they reach a certain amount of clicks
- Today: expiryDate - to delete shorts automatically in a specificed time

Because of limited bandwith and CPU time, on PythonAnywhere there I'm choosing to only have 1 expiryDate run per day -
this means you can choose from minimum of 1 day of expiry to maximum how much you want.

> PythonAnywhere has limited bandwidths and so our project is limited too... :(
