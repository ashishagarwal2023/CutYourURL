# 27 March 2024:

## New Features

- Added column "createdBy"
- Column "createdBy" also appears in the recents
- Only logged-in users can now make shorts

And for a security patch, I've added auto-logout.
- Added Auto-logout for whenever needed

You will automatically be logged out if you're logged in while the server doesn't have your information (because of some issues) from now on.

> Very soon, coming to not allow you to attempt to re-make a short that was made by someone else.
