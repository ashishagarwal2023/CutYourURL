## News

- The website is now live! You can access it at [cutyoururl.tech](https://cutyoururl.tech/)
- It will redirect you to the same path route as you try to access - for example, you will go to [cutyoururl.tech/s/JqW7Pt](https://cutyoururl.tech/s/JqW7Pt) but cutyoururl.tech will simply redirect you to the PythonAnywhere one and you will go to PythonAnywhere, then our main server will take you to destination.

I'm working to resolve the issue where the connection is not secure, might be done tommorow.
