> Warning: DO NOT RUN ANY FILE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING. Running the edit file or delete file can accidentally RESET YOUR DATABASE.

Only run these files if you know what are you doing. Make sure you know good SQL language so that you can understand what happens with these scripts.

These scripts are only for purposes when you need to manually or yourself delete a command. I might look into making a dashboard soon (for only one account, the admin one, when I add login)
