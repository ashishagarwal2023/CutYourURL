> Warning: DO NOT RUN ANY FILE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING. Running the edit file or delete file can accidentally RESET YOUR DATABASE.

Only run these files if you know what are you doing. Make sure you know good SQL language so that you can understand what happens with these scripts.

> If you are looking to reset your database, just delete the cache/shorts.db file and restart the flask server (auto restart might not work). Delete logs too since you deleted the data they are useless.

These scripts are only for purposes when you need to manually or yourself delete a command. I might look into making a dashboard soon (for only one account, the admin one, when I add login)
